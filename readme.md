## Googe Play-Hypothesis Testing

The objective of this project is to highlight some specific characteristics of the most popular apps by rating at Google Play Store.

I aim to answer the following questions:

- Are paid apps better rated than free apps?
- Are highly popular apps, in terms of downloads, better rated than less popular apps?
- Is the highest rated category statistically better than the rest?

For this I will counduct hypothesis testing using a two-sample unpaired T-test.

The data was obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps and cleaned in the notebook DataCleaning_GooglePlay. 
It is a sample of ratings from the Google Play Store between 2016 and 2018.

The csv file in the repository contains the necessary data to run the workbook.
